In 2020 I have cleared 4 technical certifications - AWS Certified Solution Architect (January 2020), AWS Certified SysOps Administrator (November 2020), AWS Certified Developer (December 2020) and AWS Cloud Practitioner (December 2020).

My strategy for preparation was fairly simple - I have used combination of self-paced video course from A Cloud Guru, practice exams from Jon Bonso and AWS public whitepapers.

Total preparation time was 9-10 weeks, in average 1 hour per day. In total, around 70-80 hours.

I'm using [Pomodorro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) technique to track productive time.  Picture below is from Pomodorro app that I'm using and shows time investment categories over last 3 months .

60% of total time I have spent on "Technical Training" category which mostly consist of preparations for technical certifications, reading whitepapers and etc. So, it is quite time consuming. 

If I will range exams from easiest to hardest, it will look like:

1. AWS Cloud Practitioner
2. AWS Certified Solution Architect - Associate
3. AWS Certified Developer
4. AWS Certified Sysops Administrator

For the next year my targets are AWS Certified Solution Architect - Professional and, potentially, AWS Certified DevOps - Professional exams.
