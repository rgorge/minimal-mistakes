I got my second AWS certification - AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate! 

Score: 874 out of 1000

Total preparation time: 5 weeks, from 30 minutes to 1 hour per day.

Materials used: 

- [Ultimate AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate 2020 by Stephane Marek](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/)
- [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate Practice Exams by Jon Bonso](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate-practice-exams-soa-c01/)
- Various AWS whitepapers

Overall, exam questions are quite difficult and I don't think it is possible to pass it without solid preparation.

Next target is AWS Certified Developer Associate.
