Very long and very controversial novel. So controversial that I will refrain from commenting it.

It is worth to mention that novel was awarded two of the most prestigious French literary awards, the Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française and the Prix Goncourt in 2006.

My personal score 4.5 out 5.
