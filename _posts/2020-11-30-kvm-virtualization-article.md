I have published new article - KVM Virtualization 101. This article as an attempt to provide “minimal valuable pack” of knowledge that is required to understand any KVM virtualized solution.

I have written it back in September 2019 for my old friend [Marat Sibgatullin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marat-sibgatulin/) - https://linkmeup.ru/blog/473.html. 

Now it is translated to English and available on resources below:
