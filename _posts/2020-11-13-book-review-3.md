Excellent book with a lot of practice drills to improve spead of reading. Most of the advices are easy and straightforward to understand, but it will require commiment and time investment to master speed reading skill.

I'm gonna practice following skills:
- Setting a purpose before starting to read
- Preview reading materials
- Space reading
- Remove subvocalization
- Reduce fixation and regression
- Practice peripheral vision
- Look for key sentences and meanings in text
- Do recall and review after every 30 minutes of reading
- Eye exercises at the end of the day

Overall rating - 5 out of 5.
