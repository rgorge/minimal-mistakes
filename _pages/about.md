My name is Roman Gorge. 

I dive deep into technology and think big to solve business and technnical challenges. 

I manage products, teams, customers and, if required, expectations.

I'm passionate about what I'm doing and have skills to make things done. 

I have extensive background in various positions in Tech - Solution Architect, Cloud Engineer, Product Manager. Over the last decade I had an opportunity to work in different roles and different countries, primarily focusing on ICT customers and technologies. 

In any role I take I bring clarity, commitment and results.

Today, I'm working as Senior Technical Account Manager in Amazon Web Services - helping enterprises in Northern Europe to adopt Cloud.
